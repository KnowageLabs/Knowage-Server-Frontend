# i18n and translation guide

Translations contributions are very well welcome from the community.

At the moment to participate it is possible to use [gitLocalize](https://gitlocalize.com/). Those are the steps to follow:

1. Log yourself on gitLocalize (it uses a Github account)
2. Search the knowage-server-frontend project between the available ones
3. Navigate to your desired language
4. Make your changes
5. When you are happy with your changes request a review

We will make checks on the language coherence. If everything is ok we will merge your changes in the project!

If your language is not on the list just write us so we can add it!
